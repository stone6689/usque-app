# Local patch record

Source: `ts_netstack_smoltcp_core 0.4.0` from crates.io
Upstream: <https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-rs>
License: BSD-3-Clause

The runtime and test smoltcp dependencies are pinned to `=0.14.0`, matching
Usque's workspace dependency. Keeping one version preserves feature unification:
the core enables IPv4, IPv6 and socket support, while Usque selects the 16 KiB
fragmentation buffer. Updating only the workspace would leave the core on 0.13
and compile a separate 0.14 without the required protocol features. The core's
standalone lockfile is updated together with the workspace lockfile.
The core's existing `std` feature now forwards to `smoltcp/std`, and standalone
tests enable it explicitly: smoltcp 0.14's CUBIC implementation uses standard
floating-point operations. This retains CUBIC on the application's existing
standard-library targets without enabling smoltcp's default physical devices.

Usque carries one behavior fix in `src/lib.rs`:

- Before replaying a command previously returned as `WouldBlock`, discard it
  when its one-shot response receiver has disconnected. Async timeout
  cancellation otherwise leaves a stale UDP receive in the blocked queue; a
  subsequent socket close removes the handle and replay panics inside smoltcp.

The patch must be removed in favor of an upstream release once an equivalent
fix is published and the DNS timeout regression test passes against it.

The opt-in L4 TUN adapter also requires bounded listener allocations,
single-accept listeners without spare sockets, and an explicit TCP abort
command. These use the existing per-stack TCP buffer accounting and keep
unselected listener behavior unchanged. Stale queued TCP commands and duplicate
close requests return an error rather than dereferencing a removed handle.
No network protocol dependency or platform mutation is added.

One-shot listener ownership transfers to the accepted TUN stream. A closed
socket slot is not recycled until that unique listener token is released;
late stream cleanup therefore cannot abort a different socket that reused its
index. Cancelled response delivery also reclaims the allocated listener/socket.

L4 cleanup uses the additive `try_request_nonblocking` entry point. It reports
queue saturation as `TryRequestError::Full`, distinct from a closed stack;
the legacy best-effort entry point remains source-compatible. This lets the
single-owner L4 wrapper enqueue a bounded asynchronous cleanup retry instead
of silently losing Close when the command queue is full. A regression checks
both a one-slot queue and the production 256-slot queue.

Closing a one-shot listener immediately drains already-closed socket allocations
after releasing the unique listener owner. Reclamation no longer waits for an
unrelated packet to make the stack report I/O progress; live or still-owned
sockets retain the existing close/ownership checks.

The outer `ts_netstack_smoltcp` crate is not patched or replaced. Usque's
first-party packet device reserves every TX queue slot before giving smoltcp
a token, avoiding that crate's blocking bounded-pipe send implementation.

Socket creation cancellation also covers TCP connect and UDP bind, including
the interval after a response is queued and before its handle is received.
The core retains the response sender until the response is consumed. The
locked flume implementation leaves an unconsumed message queued when its last
receiver drops; tests cover both queued cancellation and successful handoff.
Disconnected connect requests abort their pending socket and immediately free
its TCP reservation. Already cancelled creation commands allocate nothing.
Async creation cancellation disconnects the reply and submits a nonblocking
`ReapCancelled` wake. A full command queue already wakes the actor, whose next
I/O pass performs the same cleanup. No packet or external interface changes.

Raw socket creation now participates in the same cancellation ownership tracking
as UDP bind and TCP connect. Unclaimed IPv6 fragment sockets are reclaimed before
or after response delivery, including a saturated command queue. First-party
UDP and raw wrappers own their handles exclusively and retry Close through the
existing bounded cleanup path; the upstream best-effort socket Drop is not used
for final DNS or chained protocol transport.

An additive `BindWithReceiveBuffer` UDP command allows a bounded receive-only
override (at most 128 KiB and 512 metadata entries). Ordinary binds and all
transmit buffers retain the configured sizes. Only Usque's private VPN-protocol
underlay selects this override; DNS and SOCKS UDP associations retain their
existing allocation policy. A 64-packet burst of 1248-byte payloads previously
delivered only 52 packets through the 64 KiB receive ring. The first-party memory
regression also covers 300 ACK-sized packets, eight 16000-byte datagrams, packet
order, and an abandoned public receive waiter.
The new bind participates in the same cancelled-creation reclamation as the
original bind. Invalid dimensions are rejected before allocation. This changes
bounded in-memory buffering, with no physical socket, routing or platform change.
