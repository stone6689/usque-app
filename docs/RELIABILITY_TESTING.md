# Reliability test environments

Usque separates deterministic pull-request evidence from destructive or
network-observer release evidence. Missing infrastructure is never converted
to a pass, and protected-runner availability does not gate publication.

## Pull-request gate

The normal CI workflow runs locked Rust tests and Clippy, protobuf wire
fixtures, the diagnostic runner and fault-injection tests, Android JVM tests,
Flutter analysis, controller tests, responsive widget tests, and diagnostic
bundle privacy tests. It also runs the performance-v2 parser, JSON-schema
contract, fixture reproduction, budget-boundary arithmetic, and deterministic
microbenchmark correctness tests. Shared-runner wall-clock timings are never
treated as performance truth. These jobs do not require a public endpoint and
do not change host routes, DNS, firewall, proxy, or TUN state.

The Windows native setup and uninstall interfaces also have compile-only and
inert state/process tests. The x64 and ARM64 MSI authoring matrix validates
language transforms, ICE, overwrite policy, quiet launchers and temporary Burn
signing without executing a bundle or installing a product. These checks
belong to the ordinary CI/Build gates and do not establish real installation,
upgrade, removal, Windows accessibility or platform-state restoration.

## Windows Geo DNS and orphaned TUN regression coverage

Windows physical DNS discovery uses `GetAdaptersAddresses` for effective
per-interface servers, including DHCP. `GetInterfaceDnsSettings` remains a
separate static-configuration snapshot for rollback; DHCP values must not be
persisted as static DNS. Bounded native-buffer fixtures cover IPv4/IPv6,
missing interfaces, malformed pointers/lengths, cycles and duplicate LUIDs.

Recovery uses journal schema v5, reads v2/v3/v4 conservatively, and retains the
operation/owner/generation guards. Device ownership and connection receipts
are recorded in the same atomically replaced protected journal. Legacy versions
cannot claim the new automatic endpoint policy or WFP metadata receipts. The
automatic policy validates exact leased targets; it never installs prefix
permissions. Recovery closes dynamic leases before removing journal-owned WFP
metadata. The adapter GUID is the RequestedGUID passed to pinned Wintun 0.14.1;
its exact `SWD\Wintun\{GUID}` device-instance identity is checked using SetupAPI,
including non-present devices. Recovery does not call `WintunOpenAdapter` as
an existence probe. A registry-read failure is no longer convertible into
device absence. Both PnP and IP Helper must confirm absence before adapter
cleanup succeeds; lingering rows remain pending, and query/identity failures
retain recovery evidence.

Schema v4 introduced automatic-endpoint and WFP-metadata receipts. Schema v5
adds a write-ahead protected-replacement record outside ordinary connection
cleanup steps. Legacy journals migrate without inventing either kind of new
receipt; a pre-v5 journal containing a replacement record is rejected.
Older Agents cannot read schema v5. The Agent protocol stays at version 3,
with an explicit `protected_tunnel_replacement` capability. See the
[protected replacement contract](NETWORK_SETTINGS.md#protected-windows-operation-replacement).

A released LUID can identify another VPN's adapter. DNS/address/MTU rollback
therefore receives the original adapter identity and never writes through an
unverified retired LUID. Default-route receipts are handled individually:
physical exclusions still require explicit cleanup, and a route still present
on a reused tunnel LUID remains a conflict rather than being deleted. Adapter
removal cannot supersede route, WFP, proxy or persistence failures.

Engine startup failures retain both the original typed error and any rollback
error. A compound failure uses the existing recovery error channel with no
transport fallback. New startup log fields and displayed compound summaries
contain allowlisted stage/error codes only, not remote messages, credentials,
adapter identifiers or network addresses. The Agent's existing sanitized
step/API/Win32 recovery diagnostics remain available locally. No automatic
diagnostic upload is added.

Run Windows deterministic tests with the pinned build helper in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`; the existing Windows x64-v2 Build job also runs these tests.
The Ubuntu Rust CI job does not execute `cfg(windows)` tests.
These fixtures are not lifecycle or leak evidence. In a snapshot VM, cover
DHCP/static DNS, Geo off/CN, Kill Switch and system proxy, reattachment,
reboot/full shutdown/Fast Startup, abrupt termination and a second VPN reusing
a freed LUID. Verify first connection, rollback and old phase-7 journals; use
the independent observer for leak claims. Those isolated scenarios are
`not_run` for this workstation change. They remain supplemental, not a new
publication prerequisite.

## Windows bootstrap egress and Kill Switch ordering

The Prepared phase has no WFP provider or sublayer. It authorizes only the
planned MASQUE TCP/UDP endpoints and TCP registration API endpoints; physical
interface binding, exact network-generation checks and authenticated pipe
ownership still apply. Those same endpoints have persistent Engine-scoped
permits at commit, so bootstrap socket leases remain valid across activation
without creating dynamic filters. Other direct targets are rejected before
commit and require a dynamic permit while the active Kill Switch is enabled.

Deterministic Windows tests cover the shared bootstrap/committed allowlist,
IPv4/IPv6 and port/protocol restrictions, pre-commit rejection, active permit
failure propagation, invalid phases and sanitized egress error codes/stages.
They do not call native WFP mutation APIs. No journal schema, protobuf field,
terminal block rule or dynamic-session cleanup contract changes.

In a snapshot VM with an independent management channel, additionally validate
clean-state cold connections with Kill Switch on/off, H2/H3 and IPv4/IPv6;
registration pin refresh; held endpoint sockets across commit; and startup
failure followed by rollback and retry. Use the independent network observer
to verify post-commit direct traffic, permit revocation and no unexpected
physical packets. Missing protected infrastructure means `not_run`, not a pass.

## Windows Wintun device and connection lifetimes

The first TUN connection lazily creates one Agent-managed device. Its name and
RequestedGUID come from a device ID, independent of the account Profile. The
Agent retains the creator handle while the application holds its device lease.
An idle device is normal, not pending cleanup. Ordinary disconnect, account or
settings replacement, and VPN Gate node changes do not call
`WintunCloseAdapter` or wait for interface-table disappearance. Each replacement
still ends its packet session and restores that connection's address, DNS,
route, WFP, dynamic-egress and proxy receipts before another session starts.
For protected HTTP/SOCKS operation replacement, a separate journaled WFP guard
bridges that restoration and the successor's commit, including when the saved
Kill Switch is off. Unconfirmed cleanup retains protection and blocks reuse;
an explicit user disconnect follows the authenticated abort path. The guard
preserves only validated direct exceptions and never authorizes a WARP-only
fallback. Deterministic replacement and abort fixtures do not prove native WFP
restoration or absence of traffic leaks; those require the isolated environments.
Hot Gate transitions retain their existing guard and refresh final configuration.

Schema v3 separates the managed device (creating, idle, in use, retiring or
recovery required; an absent record means absent) from each connection
transaction. A transaction binds a device ID and generation. Creation, binding
and retirement intents are saved before native work; failed idle or final saves
bar reuse. A v2 adapter remains a legacy transaction receipt until recovered.
An idle record from an earlier Agent process is never proof of a live creator
handle. Existing Active reattachment still validates exact resources and owner.

Protocol version 3 adds the `reusable_tun_device` capability, independent
Acquire/ReleaseDeviceLease requests, lease ID/generation and expected journal
generation in Prepare, and typed device status. Engine owns the long-lived
device pipe in its application service, outside each VPN runtime. Other users
and simultaneous owners cannot take over it. Stale replies, lease EOF and
30-second orphan timers cannot retire a newer lease. Engine without prior TUN
use creates no idle device. New TUN setup requires a matching Agent capability;
diagnostics remain compatible with old Agents without that capability.

On complete application exit, Engine finishes connection cleanup and explicitly
releases the device lease. Final retirement retains the exact interface AND
PnP absence check. One bounded retirement attempt may leave only a device
record; after that record is durably saved, Agent can stop normally. This
exception cannot bypass network cleanup or failed persistence, and performs
no terminal-state sampling or recovery-budget restart. Startup retires the old
device before permitting a new creation. Native deletion delays can still
affect an immediate application restart; device reuse does not prove those
delays are fixed. A native worker owns its resources until completion or process
exit; a timeout never authorizes another native owner in that process.
An Engine crash or broken lease retains the 30-second reattachment grace.
If a retirement journal write fails with an I/O error, the existing service
supervisor retries the outstanding write every five seconds until it succeeds
or the service stops. It retains the native retirement result, so a completed
or timed-out deletion is never started again by a persistence retry. A failed
intent write must succeed before the single native attempt can start. These
retries do not consume or refresh the connection recovery budget; reuse and
idle exit remain blocked until the required record is durable.
An unused service with no device, clients or recovery jobs keeps its 10-second
idle-exit grace; an application-held idle device outlives it.

Cold reconfiguration stops MASQUE, proxy and GEO producers as well as the
Windows packet consumers before platform rollback. Hot TUN detach retains its
separate platform-only stop path. Agent packet drains check shutdown after
bounded batches even when the input ring never becomes empty. Authenticated
rollback revokes dynamic egress only after packet-session quiescence and before
removing persistent WFP resources; failed quiescence retains protection.

Engine packet shutdown owns and joins the actual blocking notification task.
The five-second join threshold records `PACKET_PUMPS_JOIN_PENDING` and retains
unfinished work; it does not authorize a new packet session or claim that the
worker exited. Cancelling a foreground connection wait leaves the background
cleanup handle owned by the service, so later Connect/Retry requests still
wait for the same cleanup.

Wintun removal first observes the exact journaled interface and PnP identity.
Both must be absent before cleanup succeeds. Closing a handle gets a two-second
observation grace; an exact-device removal request then has a ten-second total
observation window per pass. Successful requests are retained per adapter GUID
in the running Agent, so later automatic passes observe rather than repeatedly
issuing DIF_REMOVE. These are observation bounds, not a claim that Windows
native calls can be forcibly cancelled. Inspection errors remain unknown,
never absence. A request error followed by verified absence is idempotent
success. A fresh Agent may safely retry the exact journaled device.

Connect and Retry share a live Agent recovery preflight on connections that
need the Agent. This includes the first connection after an Engine restart;
it does not depend on a cached Engine error. Waiting/Running are observed,
Blocked remains an explicit error, and an explicit request can restart an
Exhausted recovery once. Background reconnection and monitoring cannot refresh
the three-attempt budget. Cancellation invalidates the connection intent even
when the Agent still needs to finish cleanup. VPN Gate hot retry retains its
existing underlay and bypasses this cold-connection preflight.

An authenticated restart first rechecks the operation, generation, caller and
absence of live sessions. If
the adapter is the only unfinished step and both resources are now absent,
it completes only the journal save. No remaining route, DNS, WFP or proxy
receipt may be skipped; a failed save retains RecoveryRequired.

The Agent writes bounded, non-authoritative `recovery-events-v1.jsonl` beside
its protected journal (at most 1 MiB). It records step results, durations,
allowlisted API names, numeric errors and optional device/interface observations,
not raw messages, receipts, addresses or identities. Logging failure never
prevents cleanup. True uninstall removes the two allowlisted recovery evidence
files (`recovery-events-v1.jsonl` and `recovery-trace-v1.jsonl`) only after
the authoritative journal is clean. Engine logs mirror allowlisted adapter
failure details, while the UI shows localized cleanup context without raw data.

`InspectPlatformState` optionally includes `recovery_diagnostics` at field 18;
the Agent protocol remains version 3. A current observation has its own sample
time, journal generation, separate interface/PnP presence and typed identity/API
results. History contains up to the latest 32 valid events with their original
timestamps, generations, step durations and outcomes. A missing, corrupt,
oversized or unreadable event file has an explicit status. Unknown JSON fields
are discarded, and enum values are validated before reserialization.

Sampling uses IP Helper, SetupAPI and read-only `CM_Get_DevNode_Status`. Interface
operational/admin/media states and devnode status/problem codes supplement the
presence results. `CONFIGRET` errors have a separate field from Win32 errors;
neither can be interpreted as resource absence. A single
blocking worker owns the sampling permit until native calls actually finish,
including after the caller times out. Agent inspection is bounded below two
seconds and the Engine waits at most two seconds. Busy, timeout, unavailable,
missing receipt and generation change never mean absence; a generation change
discards the sample's presence results. Neither inspection nor exporting opens
Wintun, starts the Agent service, or performs recovery.

Windows diagnostic exports include `windows-recovery.json` (schema version 2).
Current observations, historical events, automatic recovery and typed device
state are separate. Version 2 removes the trace and cached-evidence sections. An older Agent still permits export with `extension_unavailable`.
Both sides reconstruct allowlisted fields with bounded history; the export
excludes journal contents, arbitrary error text, adapter names/GUIDs/LUIDs,
SIDs, addresses and credentials. Existing diagnostic result evidence shows
sample status/time/generation and bounded event counts. These observations are
non-authoritative and do not weaken the two-resource cleanup success check.

Legacy protobuf trace fields remain deprecated with their occupied numbers.
Current code does not produce/export native logger callbacks, reference-count
or function-boundary traces, periodic exhausted-state samples, an Engine
evidence recorder/cache, or a final shutdown capture. Only fixed-name legacy
file deletion remains in uninstall/local-data clearing; source cleanup never
deletes user diagnostic archives or the live recovery journal.

Deterministic tests exercise at least 100 disconnect/reconnect cycles with one
device creation, one session end per cycle, and one final close. Additional
fixtures cover idle reuse, profile and Gate changes, independent proxy cleanup,
bounded recovery, actual packet-thread joins, stale/parallel ownership,
cancelled and late requests, v2/v3 persistence, failed writes, unknown identity,
device-only deferred exit, and diagnostic compatibility/privacy. The two tests
that load Wintun are ignored by default and require an isolated snapshot VM;
function-pointer/backend fixtures are not native lifecycle evidence.

In a snapshot VM with an independent management channel, additionally validate
long-lived traffic followed by immediate reconnect, full queues at disconnect,
process exit, sleep/resume, rapid reopen and another Wintun VPN. Use the network
observer for leak claims. Workstation native scenarios are `not_run`; these
supplemental checks are not a publication prerequisite.

## Protected release runners

For the planned `v0.3.1`, record unavailable isolated checks as `not_run` against the final
candidate. Historical setup, DNS, branding or endpoint-validation records may
describe earlier commits or uncommitted source; their passing deterministic
checks do not transfer to a new signed package. Any supplemental release
evidence must bind the exact staged package manifest and commit. The current
workflow accepts `v0.3.1`; the coordinated version contract and
checks are described in [Preparing v0.3.1](RELEASE.md#preparing-v031). Optional
protected-runner results do not gate publication, and cannot substitute for
required CI, compile-only, signing, package or provenance checks.

Windows same-version MSI coverage includes compile-only, inert authoring
fixtures for x64 and ARM64. `tool/test_windows_msi_replacement.ps1` verifies a
valid fixture and rejects copies with an unscoped/weakened overwrite mode,
missing UI/execute or late execute action, unsafe action condition, repair opt-in,
NeverOverwrite component, or payload outside INSTALLFOLDER. It edits only
temporary MSI databases and never installs them or runs their custom actions.

Real same-version upgrade acceptance additionally needs the snapshot VM and
independent management channel: install candidate A, then candidate B with the
same SemVer but changed GUI/Agent/Engine bytes and signing identity. Compare
the SHA-256 of every installed payload file with B, confirm the service signer
pin matches B, and verify only B remains registered. Repeat with quiet install,
an incoming `REINSTALLMODE=omus`, an intentionally modified unversioned Engine,
connected maintenance shutdown, and injected installation/recovery failure.
Rollback must restore A's matching files and registration; profiles and secrets
must survive. These scenarios are `not_run` without isolated infrastructure.

After the exact signed candidate has been staged, the release workflow selects
four explicitly labelled self-hosted runners only in a private repository and
when repository variable `RUN_PROTECTED_RELEASE_VALIDATION` is exactly `true`.
The public repository always skips these jobs, including the evidence summary;
enabling the variable alone cannot start them. Record this as `not_run`, not a
pass. Publication does not wait for these supplemental jobs:

| Runner label | Required isolation | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `usque-snapshot-vm` | Windows snapshot VM with an independent management channel | Clean install, upgrade, connected uninstall, Engine/Agent termination, sleep/network change, route/DNS/WFP/proxy restoration, Wintun residual checks |
| `usque-android-device` | Dedicated physical Android device controlled by ADB | Wi-Fi/cellular changes, airplane mode, Doze, lock/unlock, UI/VPN process reclamation, Always-on, Lockdown, reboot, upgrade, TV background/foreground |
| `usque-network-observer` | Controlled gateway outside the Engine process | H3/H2 endpoint behavior, separate IPv4/IPv6 assertions, DNS/Kill Switch/route/direct-rule packet observation |
| `usque-performance-lab` | Stable host, endpoint, topology, load and thermal policy | Seven raw baseline and candidate samples for H2 high-BDP, H3 batch I/O and allocations, queue pressure, PMTU convergence, QUIC migration and encrypted DNS |

Each runner supplies a protected `usque-reliability-runner` executable. The
repository workflow passes it the exact candidate directory, commit and output
directory. The workflow always sets `USQUE_ISOLATED_SNAPSHOT_VM=1` for the
Windows command as the protected runner's own interlock. That variable is not
evidence of isolation; isolation comes only from the snapshot VM and its
independent management channel. Do not provision these runner labels or set
that variable on a developer workstation.

## Reliability report contract

Every runner produces `report.json` with:

- schema version, exact commit and SHA-256 of `release-manifest.json`;
- an allowlisted environment class without a device identifier, SSID or user
  path;
- one result per required gate with `passed`, `failed`, `not_run` or
  `unstable`. `unstable` is produced by the performance evaluator when baseline
  or candidate samples exceed the stability budget, so no comparison is made;
  like `failed` and `not_run`, it is never accepted as a pass;
- JUnit, connection-timeline and platform-diff evidence references. Every
  reference contains a relative `path` and SHA-256, and the file must be a
  non-empty regular file below that runner class's evidence namespace;
- for independent leak gates, an external-observer marker, a zero-unexpected-
  packets assertion and a restricted PCAP path.

Each report is downloaded under its fixed artifact name and is accepted only
for the matching protected runner class: Windows, Android, independent network
observer, or performance lab. Evidence paths must start with the same
environment kind (for example `windows_snapshot_vm/`) and are resolved below a
separate restricted evidence root; traversal, symlinks, missing files, digest
mismatches, empty files, and oversized files fail closed.

`tool/reliability_gate.py` rejects unknown gates, wrong environments,
duplicates, missing or forged evidence, candidate digest mismatches, `failed`,
`unstable`, and `not_run`. It emits the validated `reliability-report.json` and
`device-matrix.md` only when all required gates pass. The release workflow keeps
that validated summary in the private execution context; missing or failed
optional runs produce no summary and do not block publication. Actions artifacts
inherit repository read access: a `restricted` name, runner label, environment
approval, or short retention period does not make a public artifact private.
PCAPs, raw lab evidence, reports, and performance samples must remain in a
private repository or another store with equivalent access controls. They are
never copied into the public diagnostic bundle or GitHub release. Running
supplemental validation for a public release requires a separately configured
private execution context bound to the exact signed candidate. Any future
public summary export must rebuild an allowlisted, sanitized summary inside
that context; the public workflow does not currently import such summaries.

Do not use the aggregator with placeholder reports to manufacture a summary
for a skipped run. A workflow job's success or skip is separate from its
evidence's acceptance: only the exact-candidate validator can accept a report.
The public release's eighteen assets contain no raw lab evidence or protected
summary, and publication's `needs` includes only `stage-candidate`.

The performance-lab report replaces the old
`performance.informational_baseline` result with these required results:

- `performance.h2_high_bdp`
- `performance.h3_batch_io`
- `performance.h3_allocation_rate`
- `performance.queue_pressure`
- `performance.pmtu_convergence`
- `performance.quic_migration`
- `performance.direct_dns`

There is no compatibility alias: the legacy result is rejected as an unknown
gate, including if marked passed. Historical PR-00 baseline documentation is
not an active gate definition. The final [acceptance matrix](network-quality-acceptance.md)
records ordinary checks separately from unavailable protected measurements.

Each result binds five artifacts: JUnit, timeline, platform diff, a v3
comparison report, and its raw-sample bundle. The reliability aggregator checks
both artifact SHA-256 values, verifies the hashes of the embedded baseline and
candidate reports, and recomputes the comparison from the checked-in scenario
and budget contracts. A runner-authored summary cannot substitute for raw
evidence.

## Instance-local fault injection

`usque-transport` extends its existing `FaultScript` (256 events) with H2
PING/capacity, batch partial/unsupported/truncated/WouldBlock, pool exhaustion,
CID/candidate setup/validation, EMSGSIZE/PMTU, DoH TLS/HTTP/body, DoT prefix/EOF
and DNS-pool cancellation points. Each due event is consumed once at the real
component boundary. Scripts are per telemetry/runtime instance, not global;
capacity-delay injection is at most ten seconds and partial counts are 1–64.
Unit tests may inject scripts; explicit `fault-injection` lab builds must
retain debug assertions. Non-test release builds reject that feature at
compile time. There is no Profile, environment, IPC or remote fault interface.
Synthetic faults verify cleanup/state logic, not external packet observations
or performance targets. The seven v2 gates still require actual lab samples.

## Performance samples v2 and evidence bundles v3

`tool/schemas/performance_report.schema.json` is the wire contract. A measured
baseline or candidate report contains exactly seven ordered raw samples. Units
are part of field names (`goodput_bps`, `latency_p95_us`, `cpu_time_ms`, and
`rss_peak_bytes`); unknown or unit-substituted fields fail closed. Environment
data is limited to an allowlisted network-profile ID, stable thermal and battery
policies, and numeric tool versions. Hostname, username, SSID, IP address, and
device-serial fields are forbidden. A report that could not be measured has
status `not_run`, an allowlisted reason code, and no samples; it is never a
pass.

Baseline and candidate must use the same scenario, platform class, network
profile, and major runner/Rust toolchain. `tool/performance_gate.py` calculates
the median, minimum, maximum, and median absolute deviation (MAD) over the seven
runs. Latency is the median of the seven per-run p95 values. Throughput
MAD/median above 10% or latency MAD/median above 15% yields `unstable`, never a
best-run selection.

`tool/performance_budget.json` records the numeric contract. Steady-state
limits are inclusive: throughput at least 95% of baseline, median p95 latency at
most 110%, CPU per bit at most 105%, and RSS at most 110% with no more than a
32 MiB absolute increase. The scenario-specific checks additionally require
zero reference queue drops, no more than 0.5 UDP syscalls per datagram,
allocation and feature-acceptance limits, PMTU stability within 30 seconds with
no send-error spin or silent truncation, same-family migration p95 within one
second and fallback within eight seconds, and encrypted-DNS success of at least
99% with zero physical port-53 or plaintext-fallback observations.

The protected job requires repository variable
`PERFORMANCE_ACCEPTED_BASELINE_COMMIT` to contain a full lowercase commit. It
runs both baseline and candidate seven times for every entry in
`tool/performance_scenarios.json`, then the repository evaluator creates the
bound reliability report. The evaluator independently receives the accepted
baseline through required `--baseline-commit`; every raw baseline/candidate
identity must match that value and the staged candidate. The evidence validator
also binds every raw report's identities to its comparison and release candidate,
not only to matching file digests.

H2 high-BDP has two mandatory scenario entries, not two interchangeable profiles:
the single-flow `h2-high-bdp` scenario uses network profile `h2-bdp-100ms`, and
the four-flow `h2-high-bdp-four-flow` scenario uses `h2-bdp-500ms`. The
repository treats these profile IDs as opaque allowlisted identifiers. It does
not define or record their link rate, RTT or workload direction. Baseline and
candidate reports must name the same profile. Each scenario requires its own
seven-sample baseline and candidate file. There are sixteen input files across
eight scenarios but still seven stable gate IDs. `performance.h2_high_bdp`
passes only if both scenario comparisons pass;
a missing, failed, unstable, or not-run scenario cannot be represented by the other.

Version-3 evidence bundles contain `baseline_reports` and `candidate_reports`
arrays covering every required scenario exactly once, plus corresponding array
digests in the comparison. The validator recomputes the complete grouped gate.
Raw measurement reports remain schema v2; obsolete singular-report evidence
bundles cannot prove complete coverage under the new contract.

Missing baseline configuration, a malformed report,
six or eight samples, instability, a budget failure, or `not_run` makes that
supplemental job fail. As with the other protected runners, absence or failure
is not publication success but does not become a publication prerequisite.

The final public release includes the signed packages, per-package SPDX SBOMs,
`release-manifest.json`, and `SHA256SUMS`. Package checksums are calculated after
signing and against the same immutable candidate offered to any enabled
protected runners.
