# Direct DNS: System, DoH and DoT

Direct DNS controls name lookups for destinations selected by country-based or custom domain
direct rules. It is shared across accounts. It does not change other tunnel DNS,
intercept an application's own encrypted DNS, or decrypt unrelated traffic.

## Choose a mode

| Mode in the app | Where matching queries go | What you need to configure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current network DNS (System, the default) | The DNS servers on your current network, outside the VPN. Those servers can see the queried names. | No custom resolver fields. |
| DNS over HTTPS (DoH) | The encrypted resolver you choose, over HTTPS. | Complete HTTPS URL and bootstrap IP addresses. |
| DNS over TLS (DoT) | The encrypted resolver you choose, over TLS. | TLS server name, port and bootstrap IP addresses. |

The chosen DoH/DoT provider can see the names it resolves. Encryption protects
the connection to that provider; it does not make queries anonymous to it.
New encrypted DNS drafts prefill Cloudflare: DoH uses
`https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query`, and DoT uses `one.one.one.one:853`.
Both prefill `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`, `2606:4700:4700::1111` and
`2606:4700:4700::1001`. Existing saved values are preserved. These are editable
drafts and do not change the System default until you select and apply a mode.

## Configure direct DNS

1. In **Settings → Bypass settings**, select the countries and download
   their GeoIP rules and the global GeoSite catalog, then save the selection.
   Alternatively, add domains with the **DIRECT** action under **Custom routing
   rules**; these do not need geographic downloads. If no country rule or DIRECT
   domain rule matches, these DNS settings are not used.
2. Open **Settings → Advanced network settings → Direct DNS**.
3. Choose System, DoH or DoT. Keep the Cloudflare defaults for a new encrypted
   draft, or enter your provider's values using the field guide below.
4. Select **Apply changes**. Editing or resetting fields alone does not apply
   them. Read the save result and pending-state message; reconnect manually if
   the change is saved for the next connection.
5. Check **Network quality → Direct DNS** while connected. To test reachability,
   run a confirmed [Deep diagnostic](network-doctor.md).

In Simplified Chinese, the bypass page is **设置 → 分流设置**. Direct DNS is under
**设置 → 高级网络设置 → 直连 DNS**. The System option is currently labelled
**当前网络的 DNS**.

### Field guide

| Field | What to enter | Format example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DoH URL | Complete HTTPS URL with the provider's DNS name and path. An optional custom port belongs in the URL. No credentials, query string or fragment. | `https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query` |
| DNS server name (DoT) | The provider's certificate name, without a scheme, port or path. Do not enter an IP here. | `one.one.one.one` |
| Port (DoT; 0 uses the default) | `853`, or a custom port specified by the provider. | `853` |
| DNS server IP addresses | One to eight distinct IP addresses for that resolver, preferably one per line. Usque connects to these addresses without first using system DNS to find the server. | `1.1.1.1` and `2606:4700:4700::1111` |

The Cloudflare endpoints above are working defaults; use the provider's actual
IP addresses if you choose another resolver. Direct DNS still requires 1–8
bootstrap IPs. DoT has no HTTPS path. The TLS certificate must match the name
even though the connection uses a numeric IP address.

Saved DoH name, port and path fields automatically display as one URL, without
rewriting the stored configuration. Custom ports, paths and bootstrap IPs are
preserved. Switching modes retains separate drafts. Resetting Advanced settings
clears these drafts; selecting an encrypted mode afterward prefills Cloudflare.
All changes still require **Apply changes**.

## If it does not work

- A validation error usually identifies a malformed name, path, port or IP.
  Correct the field; failed validation does not save a different DNS mode.
- If the encrypted resolver cannot be reached or authenticated, matching
  queries fail. Usque does not switch them to System or plaintext DNS.
  Check the provider's name, IP addresses, path, port and network reachability.
- If the Engine does not support encrypted direct DNS, saved custom values stay
  visible but unavailable for use. Use a compatible Engine, or explicitly choose
  System if that is your intended privacy policy.
- Apps using their own encrypted DNS hide names from Usque, so country routing
  uses IP rules. The direct-DNS selector does not control those apps' resolvers.

Other remote VPN queries use the final exit's DNS: WARP® without a chain, or the
active chain exit (custom OpenVPN or WireGuard, WARP via WireGuard, or VPN
Gate). Ordinary WARP supports configurable Plain DNS, DoH and DoT; see
[WARP exit DNS](WARP_DNS.md).
See the [direct DNS threat model](direct-dns-threat-model.md) for platform
protection and diagnostic limits.

## Implementation reference

A runtime `Profile` receives a copy of the shared network settings. It is not a
separate per-account direct-DNS preference. The following sections specify input
validation, protocol handling and resource ownership.

### Configuration and trust

`DirectDnsSettings` is validated in core before opening a connection. TLS
server name, port and path remain the persisted and IPC representation; the
editor splits the HTTPS URL into these fields without decoding its path.
An omitted URL port uses `443`; an omitted path uses `/dns-query`. TLS
server names are IDNA-normalized DNS names, at most 253 characters/ASCII bytes
after normalization, and validated with rustls `ServerName`. URL syntax,
wildcards, empty labels, control characters and whitespace are rejected rather
than silently trimmed. Numeric IPs belong only in the bootstrap list.

The list contains 1–8 distinct numerical unicast IPs. Private unicast is
allowed for enterprise resolvers. Unspecified, multicast, IPv4 broadcast and
unscoped IPv6 link-local addresses are rejected. The current `IpAddr` settings
do not carry a link-local scope, so link-local IPv6 cannot be used.

Port zero canonicalizes to 443 (DoH) or 853 (DoT). DoH paths are ASCII paths
starting with one `/`, at most 256 bytes, with no query, fragment, URL/host
syntax, backslash, whitespace or control characters. An empty DoH path becomes
`/dns-query`. DoT requires an empty path. Canonical physical-system JSON retains
only `mode`; stale custom fields are cleared before saving.

Production TLS uses the existing explicit ring provider and webpki roots,
normal name/validity/chain verification and no early data. There is no custom
CA, certificate-ignore switch or pin override. Test roots exist only in unit
fixtures. DoH requires negotiated `h2`; DoT does not require HTTP ALPN.

After TLS chooses a bootstrap address, HTTP/2 preface failures retain that
address for the existing one-retry exclusion policy. The failed stream and
lease are dropped before retry. The two-address budget, total query deadline,
and no-retry-on-timeout policy are unchanged. Both an outer deadline expiry
and a transport-reported preface I/O timeout preserve the Timeout classification.

### Protocol and semantic validation

DoH uses HTTP/2 POST, HTTPS authority derived from the configured name/port,
the configured path and `application/dns-message` for Content-Type and Accept.
Only status 200 is accepted; redirects are never followed. Media types are
parsed completely, including legal token/quoted parameters, not matched with
substring searches. Bodies are capped at 65,535 bytes; rejected/abandoned
streams are reset. Its receive windows are 65,535 bytes per stream and
256 KiB per connection, independent of MASQUE tuning. These exchanges follow
the wire format in [RFC 8484](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8484.html).

DoT uses the two-byte big-endian message length from
[RFC 7858](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7858.html), with one outstanding
query per connection. A zero length, EOF, canceled partial exchange, or invalid
response discards that connection. Neither encrypted protocol applies the
physical UDP-to-TCP truncation fallback.

Both protocols reuse the existing Split DNS parser for transaction ID,
question, opcode, record, CNAME, TTL and route-hint validation. No second DNS
semantic parser is introduced. DNS name decoding is bounded before allocation
can grow beyond the supported name length. The application's UDP response-size
limit still applies, independently of encrypted upstream transport.

### Bounds, cancellation and generations

- At most four encrypted DNS sockets/connections, including connecting,
  retiring and Happy Eyeballs losers. Permits live with actual I/O until its
  socket and platform lease have been dropped.
- DoH: four connections, sixteen concurrent requests per connection, sixty-four
  total. DoT: four connections, one request per connection and at most sixty
  more admitted queries waiting for a slot.
- The sixty-four-query encrypted budget is separate from Split DNS's 512-task
  budget. The latter includes queued UDP replies and TCP sessions. Full
  admission returns a safe failure; no unbounded worker queue is spawned.
- Idle connections close after sixty seconds; a connection is replaced after
  at most one thousand queries. In-flight DoH streams finish before normal
  retirement; network/profile cancellation closes them immediately.
- A query has a four-second total deadline, with 2.5 seconds for socket
  preparation/connect/TLS and at most three seconds for request/response,
  always capped by the total deadline. At most one request retry uses a
  different bootstrap IP, and one query visits at most two bootstrap IPs.
- Bootstrap candidates are filtered by authoritative family availability.
  IPv6/IPv4 Happy Eyeballs starts the alternative after 250 ms (or immediately
  after a failed first candidate). Losers release their socket and lease.
- Exact-generation protection is checked before setup, after bind/protect,
  before/after TLS, before the request and before returning its result. Android
  uses the exact `Network`; Windows VPN uses the Agent's generation-tagged
  target lease. Windows proxy and disconnected desktop probes use ordinary
  host networking with a logical generation-zero lease, not Agent/WFP
  protection. Bootstrap never performs a hostname lookup.
- A bounded 100 ms generation observer cancels the old pool; every query also
  checks generation synchronously at its boundaries. New-generation requests
  cannot reuse old connections. Profile shutdown rejects new work and cancels
  old work. Queued application replies recheck generation before injection.

### No plaintext downgrade

Only the physical-system variant can discover physical DNS servers or use
plain UDP/TCP DNS. An encrypted resolver error returns a fixed error and Split
DNS replies SERVFAIL. The encrypted branch cannot change protocols, resolve a
bootstrap name with system DNS, or fall back to port 53.

The same runtime-owned pool serves Geo-selected HTTP/SOCKS proxy hostnames.
An encrypted resolution error is terminal. If resolution succeeded but a
direct data socket failed, the existing tunnel fallback reuses those resolved
IP addresses; it does not re-query the hostname through a system/configured
plaintext resolver. Physical-system routing keeps its existing fallback.

Disabling the internal encrypted-DNS capability rejects an encrypted Profile
before connection. It never rewrites the saved mode or silently substitutes
physical-system DNS. Users may explicitly change the Profile themselves.

### Privacy and validation limits

#### Profile/config schema 13 (introduction)

Direct DNS was introduced in configuration schema 13; later
[configuration migrations](../crates/usque-core/src/storage.rs) keep these fields.
`AppConfig.network.direct_dns` is hydrated into each account's runtime
Profile. Old schema-12 configurations and missing protobuf Profile field 17
canonicalize to System. Shared settings, not per-account endpoint overlays,
select DNS. `DirectDnsSettings` wire fields 1–5 are mode, server name, DoH path,
bootstrap IPs, and port; unknown protobuf fields retain compatibility. Android
uses the equivalent `direct_dns` JSON object. Core validation remains
authoritative after the editor's validation. Explicit configuration export
preserves these user values; diagnostic export excludes them.

Android waits for a usable non-VPN network in every mode, but only System
Split DNS requires its physical DNS metadata. DoH/DoT bootstrap is independent
of that list. See the deployment-specific [threat model](direct-dns-threat-model.md)
and [capability rollback](network-quality-rollback.md).

Metrics contain only protocol/mode, fixed phase/reason codes, RTT, counters and
queue pressure. Direct-DNS code adds no QNAME, wire message, configured name,
bootstrap/answer IP, certificate or physical DNS server to logs, metrics or
diagnostics. Split DNS and proxy Geo fallback log events carry fixed reason
codes, not raw target or error text. Metrics stay local.

The TUN direct gateway is narrower. Its debug-level events `could not create
GEO direct flow; using tunnel` and `GEO direct flow ended` carry the error text
and the flow's `remote` address, which can be a direct answer IP. At the
default Info level they are not written. If a user selects Debug, the desktop
Engine writes them to its local `engine.jsonl` only after its log sanitizer
replaces `remote` and other sensitive keys with `[REDACTED]` and replaces
IP-, socket-address-, URL- and host-name-like tokens in strings. Other error
text remains. Diagnostic export applies the same sanitizer again. This
redaction is pattern-based, so do not treat Debug logs as free of private
network details. The Android library installs no Rust log subscriber, so these
events are not recorded there.

Workstation tests use in-memory test CA material and loopback fake DoH/DoT
servers. They cover protocol/PKI rejection, concurrency, reuse/recycle/idle
cleanup, generation races, cancellation, exact leases, bootstrap retry,
application SERVFAIL, proxy fallback and parser/media-type property fuzzing.
The fake protector panics if encrypted code calls physical DNS discovery or
hostname resolution. Existing system-mode truncation/oracle fixtures remain.

These tests are not external leak proof. Actual device/adapter binding,
observer packet counts and controlled performance evidence require the
protected environments in [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md#development-machines). Unavailable runs must be recorded as `not_run`; they do not establish leak or
performance results.

## Custom bypass targets / 自定义绕过目标

Custom targets now use the [routing rule editor](ROUTING.md): select DIRECT,
REJECT or PROXY for each domain, IP or CIDR. More-specific domains and longer
prefixes win. Legacy targets migrate to DIRECT in schema 24; custom CIDRs no
longer create OS-level bypass routes. Direct hostname resolution still uses the
Direct DNS settings described above. Rejecting a hostname prevents its DNS
query; explicit IP rejection is checked before opening a data socket.
