# Experimental Cloudflare® Zero Trust enrollment

Usque can experimentally register a new account with a Cloudflare Zero Trust organization on Windows and Android. This feature is intentionally narrower than the Cloudflare One™ Client: it uses the organization account to create a persistent device identity, then carries Internet traffic through Usque's existing MASQUE tunnel.

It does not implement organization policy synchronization, device posture, managed DNS, Split Tunnels, private-network routing, WARP-to-WARP, service-token enrollment, or automatic client-session reauthentication. The Android per-app proxy picker is a local UID filter on this device; it is not Cloudflare One Split Tunnel or organization policy sync. Gateway policy can still affect traffic on Cloudflare's side, but Usque does not claim full Cloudflare One Client compatibility.

## Enrollment flow

1. During first-run setup, or while adding an account later, select **Cloudflare Zero Trust (Experimental)**.
2. Enter the organization's single-label team name.
3. Accept the existing Cloudflare terms and open `https://<team>.cloudflareaccess.com/warp` in the system browser.
4. Complete the organization's Access/IdP login.
5. After Access login, return to Usque. Android may show an app chooser if the official WARP® client is also installed. On Windows, starting login temporarily registers Usque as the current-user Access callback handler so Windows can forward the callback to the open window. The handler is released when a valid callback arrives. You can also paste the complete `com.cloudflare.warp://.../auth?token=...` callback or fill it from the clipboard. Manual paste remains available on both platforms.
6. Wait for Usque to finish registration, then connect with the new account.
   Its initial IPv4 and IPv6 entry addresses come from registration.
   Port and SNI are shared network settings, initially `443` and
   `speed.cloudflare.com`.

The Access assertion is never written to the profile, vault, Android saved state, or logs. It is bounded to 64 KiB, accepted only for the expected team and exact callback shape, held in memory, consumed once, and discarded after submission. A restarted Android process has no active login and rejects the callback.

## Edit endpoint addresses

Open **Settings → Advanced network settings**, choose **Edit Zero Trust
endpoints**, read the red fullscreen warning, and check that you understand the
risks and are authorized to use the endpoint. Only then can you continue editing
IPv4 and IPv6. Use numeric IP addresses from a trusted, authorized source; an
incorrect address may prevent connection. The editor does not restrict manual
addresses to Cloudflare ranges. Existing TLS and endpoint public-key checks
still apply, so an arbitrary server is not guaranteed to work.

Choose **Apply changes** to save. The addresses belong only to the current ZT
account. Cancel or Back leaves them locked; each new visit requires confirmation.
ZT has no Automatic picker. Port and SNI remain shared settings.
Home also keeps a non-dismissible privacy and data-security risk notice visible
for the selected account's saved custom addresses and any still-active custom ZT
session. Restoring saved defaults alone cannot dismiss the notice while the old
custom session is still running.

**Reset network defaults** stages the latest registered addresses in the draft
without unlocking risky editing. Apply to restore them. Signing in again also
restores the newly registered addresses and removes custom addresses. A failed
save or interrupted sign-in preserves the previous settings.

## Account and registration rules

Internally, a `Profile` combines an account's identity with a copy of shared
network settings. Usque exchanges the one-time assertion for a device ID/token
and P-256 MASQUE registration, validates the returned endpoints, and saves the
identity and profile together. The rules below also cover interrupted saves.

- A profile with no provider binding, identity material, or pending identity transaction may select Consumer WARP or Zero Trust during its first provisioning. Once a provider is claimed, the existing provider boundary applies.
- Consumer profiles cannot be converted to Zero Trust profiles.
- A Zero Trust profile can sign in again only to the same organization. This refreshes its device registration, credentials, and registration-owned IPv4/IPv6 endpoint addresses and clears any custom override without replacing the shared port or SNI. Credential replacement is journaled so an interrupted local commit restores the previous credentials, registered address pair and custom override on the next startup.
- Provider and organization are mirrored in a versioned, non-secret profile binding. The vault metadata must match it; missing or conflicting metadata is invalid and may only be repaired by signing in to the bound organization. Unbound pre-feature profiles remain legacy Consumer identities.
- Zero Trust IPv4/IPv6 endpoint addresses are account-specific and may use a local override. Registration-owned addresses remain separately stored for reset and sign-in. Port and SNI are device-wide settings shared by Consumer and Zero Trust profiles; editing or resetting either from any account updates every profile. Upgrading a legacy or schema-10 configuration keeps the historical registered address pair while moving port and SNI to the shared values. An experimental schema-11 build recovers the pair from its preserved migration backup when possible; without recoverable data the identity is marked invalid and must sign in again instead of silently using Consumer addresses.
- Zero Trust profiles have no Usque WARP License operation. License copy, bind/unbind, and WARP Secret export are hidden and rejected by the engine.
- Deleting a profile removes only local credentials. It does not revoke the device registration in the organization dashboard; an administrator must remove residual or test registrations there.
- Registration never falls back to a Consumer identity after a Zero Trust failure.

## Callback handling reference

Windows does not change the default MSI tables and does not register `com.cloudflare.warp` at install time. Paste and clipboard fill always work. Starting Zero Trust login automatically creates a temporary current-user HKCU protocol association before opening the browser; there is no Settings toggle.

The complete previous HKCU registration is retained and restored after a valid callback (including manual input), cancellation, browser-launch failure, a ten-minute timeout, or normal exit. With no previous HKCU registration, cleanup removes the temporary override and exposes the machine handler again. A browser tab closed without a callback is bounded by the timeout.

Startup retries recovery after an interrupted login and removes an old persistent association owned by this executable. Cleanup never overwrites a handler newly claimed by another app; an unresolved backup blocks another automatic takeover. If Windows refuses registration, the login launch fails and manual paste remains available.

Only non-secret protocol-handler registration is saved; Access tokens remain in memory. The first Usque window remains the single UI instance: a later launch with a callback URI restores that window, forwards the URI, and exits.

Android declares a restricted browsable intent for `com.cloudflare.warp://*.cloudflareaccess.com/auth`. An in-memory login session additionally requires the exact expected team. `onCreate` and `onNewIntent` feed the same one-shot gate; callbacks without an active login, for another team, after cancellation, after process restart, or after the first accepted callback are discarded. Co-installation with the official WARP app is allowed to produce Android's normal app chooser. Windows uses the same scheme, host, path, and single-token checks before any registration request is sent.

Re-authenticating the connected profile disconnects the active tunnel before replacing credentials and registered endpoint addresses, then reconnects with the existing shared port/SNI settings.

## Requirements for production support

The enrollment exchange and `zt-masque.cloudflareclient.com` contract are experimental. Do not describe or ship this feature as production-supported until a dedicated real organization passes all of the following:

- enrollment policy permits the test identity and does not require unsupported posture;
- the dashboard attributes the device to the expected user;
- the returned IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints remain in Cloudflare's documented Zero Trust ranges;
- H3, H2 fallback, IPv4, IPv6, endpoint-pin refresh, and restart reconnection work through SOCKS5/HTTP on Windows without starting Windows VPN mode or changing routes/DNS;
- Android VPN validation passes only on an isolated test device or emulator;
- the vault, logs, diagnostic bundle, profile JSON, and Android state contain no Access assertion;
- the administrator removes every test or orphaned registration afterward.

If validation fails or has not run, keep the feature experimental and do not
promote it to production-supported status. Product publication follows
[Release process](RELEASE.md) and its required gates; supplemental protected-runner
results do not block publication. Do not silently fall back to Consumer
registration or probe undocumented API variants.
