# Code signing policy

This policy says which Usque packages are signed, who may sign them, and how to tell an official signature from a local or third-party one. How the release workflow loads keys and checks artifacts is in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md). For file-hash, signer and build-provenance commands, follow [Verify before installing](INSTALLATION.md#verify-before-installing).

## Official signatures

Only packages attached to a GitHub Release for this repository, with matching checksums and signer fingerprints, are official. Pull Request artifacts, Actions development outputs, fork builds, and local validation packages are not, even if they are signed.

Pre-1.0 official packages use two fixed, project-controlled self-signed identities:

- Windows Authenticode for the installer bundle, its detached Burn engine, its native setup EXE, the update MSI, and every EXE/DLL in the Windows application payload inside that MSI except the official Wintun DLL
- an Android release certificate for every official APK

Those identities are not a public CA and are not in the Windows Root or Trusted Publisher stores. Windows will show an unknown-publisher warning. That is expected. The installer does not install the certificate into the machine trust stores.

A v1.0.0 change of signing identity is a separate release. Until then, the pre-1.0 fingerprints published on the current GitHub Release remain the only official ones.

## Android developer verification

Official Android releases require the package name
`io.github.georgexie2333.usque` and current official release certificate to be
registered to a verified developer identity through
[Android developer verification](https://developer.android.com/developer-verification).
This is Usque's release policy; platform enforcement scope follows Android's
current documentation. Registration records package-name and signing-key ownership; it
is not an app-content review or Google Play distribution. This document does
not verify the live console registration state.

Every official Android release must use that application ID and the certificate
identified by `ANDROID_SIGNER_SHA256`, and that pair must remain **Registered**
in Android Developer Console. A planned package-name or signing-identity change
requires security review, an upgrade and migration plan, and updated registration
before distribution. Developer verification does not authorize key rotation.

## What is signed

| Artifact | Signer |
| --- | --- |
| Official Windows installer bundle, its detached Burn engine and embedded native setup EXE | project Authenticode identity |
| Official Windows MSI | project Authenticode identity |
| Every EXE/DLL in the Windows application payload inside that MSI, including Usque binaries and the Flutter engine and plugin DLLs from the Flutter release build, except the official Wintun DLL | same identity |
| Official per-ABI and universal APKs | project Android release certificate |
| Official Wintun DLL (`amd64` / `arm64`) | original vendor signature; Usque redistributes those files and does not re-sign them |
| Local validation MSI/APK | a throwaway identity created on the build machine; never official |

Unsigned project binaries must not ship in an official Windows package. The
release signs the MSI and native setup EXE before embedding them, then follows WiX's detach/sign/
reattach/sign sequence so both the Burn engine and final bundle carry the same
project identity. A signer mismatch, a modified Wintun DLL, a malformed
language transform, or a missing official fingerprint fails the release.
For verification of an already signed bundle, the engine extractor restores
the original PE checksum and certificate directory, matching Burn's cached
engine behavior, before checking Authenticode and the fixed signer. Raw
`wix burn detach` alone is not a signed-engine verification extractor.
The installed uninstall helper applies the same offline Authenticode policy
before it runs a cached hidden bundle for registration cleanup.

## Where keys live

Official private keys exist only as `release-signing` GitHub Environment secrets, plus encrypted offline backups held by the release maintainer. They must not appear in the repository, issues, pull requests, logs, caches, artifacts, or unencrypted disk on a development machine.

Public fingerprints are repository or environment variables (`WINDOWS_SIGNER_SHA256`, `ANDROID_SIGNER_SHA256`) and are printed in the GitHub Release notes. The SHA-256 is over the raw certificate (DER), 64 hex characters.

Only the release maintainer may approve `release-signing` and `release-publish`. A local bundle, MSI, or APK cannot replace a failed or missing GitHub Actions build.

For the planned `v0.3.1`, retain both pre-1.0 identities. Before approving signing, confirm
the live environment protection settings, the two public certificate
fingerprints, and Android's **Registered** application-ID/certificate pair.
Before approving publication, review the exact tagged commit and staged
`release-manifest.json`; its eight package names, sizes, SHA-256 values and
signer fingerprints must describe the candidate produced by that release run.
A documentation review, a previous release's signatures or a local compile is
not that evidence. The workflow accepts only `v0.3.1`; complete the exact-candidate
checks in [Preparing v0.3.1](RELEASE.md#preparing-v031)
before creating the new tag. Documentation preparation does not authorize key
access, signing or publication.

## What users should check

Follow [Verify before installing](INSTALLATION.md#verify-before-installing) for
platform-specific commands and the output fields to compare. Check the exact
filename's package SHA-256 against both `SHA256SUMS` and GitHub's asset digest,
then compare the certificate's SHA-256 with that release's notes. Package hashes,
certificate hashes and public-key hashes are different values. The guide also
shows how to verify GitHub's build attestation.

Do not import a signing certificate from an unofficial package, and do not turn off antivirus or the firewall to make an installer run.

On Windows, after install, the Agent accepts the official self-signed identity
only when Windows has checked the Authenticode digest and signature, the chain
result is success (`0`) or the expected `CERT_E_UNTRUSTEDROOT`, and the
certificate's DER SHA-256 matches the packaged value. Every other trust result
is rejected; success never bypasses the fixed fingerprint check.

## Rotation and compromise

Keep the current identities until a reviewed v1.0.0 (or later) signing change. Do not rotate the official pre-1.0 keys for convenience.

If an official private key may have leaked, or if a package appears with the official fingerprint but not from this repository's GitHub Release:

- revoke trust in that identity in the release notes
- stop producing packages with it
- report the event through [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)
- publish replacement packages under a new identity, with upgrade notes

A lost backup of an official key is treated the same as a compromise: do not invent a second "official" key for the same SemVer line.

## Local and development signing

`tool/build_windows_local_validation.ps1` and similar helpers may create a temporary self-signed identity, sign a validation package, then delete the key. The local validation helper creates its throwaway certificate in `CurrentUser\My` and temporarily trusts it for the current user by importing it into `CurrentUser\TrustedPeople` and `CurrentUser\TrustedPublisher`; cleanup removes it from all three stores, deletes its private key, and fails if any removal fails. Those packages are for table checks and isolated VM work only. They must not be published, renamed to look like a GitHub Release, or installed on a daily-driver machine. The multilingual bundle is produced only by the approved tag workflow; local MSI validation does not create an official bundle.

Debug and unsigned Android builds used on a developer device are not release certificates. Do not reuse the official Android keystore on a development host.

## Maintainer rules

- Do not commit PFX, keystore, or password files.
- Do not re-sign the official Wintun DLL. The release workflow excludes it by path and signs every other EXE/DLL in the payload with the project identity; it does not check whether another binary already carries a vendor signature.
- Do not add the project certificate to Root or Trusted Publisher on user machines.
- Do not sign a package whose contents were not produced by the approved release workflow for that tag.
- Signing-key or release-chain issues are vulnerabilities; handle them privately as in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
