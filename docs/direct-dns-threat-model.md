# Direct DNS threat model

## 1. Overview and effective resources

Scope: direct DNS and its actual callers, protection and diagnostic/export
boundaries; this is not a repository-wide vulnerability scan. The independent
architecture review used `1558ebfebe1ed38e969578628ffd8138166519e9`; the final
source check includes PR-12's flags, Android startup correction and native
timeline bridge. The stable target is the sanitized repository identity
`https://github.com/GeorgeXie2333/usque-app`, SHA-256
`a09f265cd93232d0857d07e515244e870406de2d40dffdfda6132591abbaa587`.
This scoped document does not replace a shared whole-repository model.
Root `SECURITY.md` is the applicable policy; no nested policy was found.

Behavior notes follow the current development source, including HTTP/SOCKS5
chain DNS. They do not extend the recorded independent review or turn its
candidate-specific evidence into leak validation for a later release. HTTP/SOCKS5 Automatic
chain DNS defaults to Cloudflare® DoH over verified TLS through the final proxy;
custom or non-default inherited DNS retains TCP DNS. That final proxy and DNS
provider have separate visibility from an explicitly direct resolver. A chosen
application resolver remains the TCP destination for converted UDP/53 queries;
there is no physical fallback. See [chain DNS choices](CHAIN_PROXY.md#http-and-socks5-exits--http-与-socks5-出口).

The ordinary WARP® service also supports explicit-bootstrap DoH and DoT inside the tunnel;
see [WARP exit DNS](WARP_DNS.md). Its encrypted connector never creates a
physical resolver socket. The WARP pool is distinct from the direct-DNS pool,
and final chain exits retain their own DNS choices. These source changes do
not extend the independent review or establish isolated leak observations.

Usque has one MASQUE runtime shared by VPN and proxy frontends. Country- or custom-domain-selected
direct traffic consumes `DirectDnsSettings`: System, DoH or DoT.
`SharedNetworkSettings` is hydrated into an account's runtime Profile;
managed-account endpoint overlays do not override DNS. Core validation is
authoritative after Flutter/protobuf or Android JSON decoding. The default is
System, including migrated/missing configuration. Code references name stable
symbols rather than line numbers. See `SharedNetworkSettings` in
`crates/usque-core/src/config/network.rs`; `DirectDnsSettings`, its `Default`
and `DirectDnsSettings::validate` in `crates/usque-core/src/config/mod.rs`;
`migrate_app_config` in `crates/usque-core/src/storage.rs`; and
`message DirectDnsSettings` plus `Profile.direct_dns = 17` in
`proto/usque/v1/control.proto`.

The following table retains each distinct deployment/workflow resource. No
configured resolver, account identifier, real endpoint or secret is reproduced.
“Encrypted bounds” means 1–8 numeric bootstrap IPs, four live socket permits
(including connecting/retiring/Happy-Eyeballs losers), 64 admitted queries,
two bootstrap visits, one retry, four seconds total, strict public-root/name/
validity TLS, no early data, DoH h2 POST/200, and DoT length framing. DoH has
16 streams per connection; DoT has one query per connection. Sources in

| Deployment / consumer | Configuration chain and effective resource | Readers / writers / recipients | Enforcing control and evidence / unknowns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows VPN / System Split DNS | Shared Profile → physical snapshot → internal `198.18.0.1` / `fd00::1` → physical DNS endpoints | User config; Agent snapshot; physical provider receives direct QNAME; other names use the WARP tunnel or the active chain exit's DNS policy, including HTTP/SOCKS5 DoH or TCP | Target-aware leases, generation checks, WFP permits when Kill Switch is on; `crates/usque-engine/src/windows_agent.rs` `WindowsVpnSocketProtector::protect_target_generation`; `crates/usque-transport/src/split_dns.rs` `SplitDnsResolver::query_direct`, `SplitDnsResolver::query_tunnel`. External observer `not_run`. |
| Android VPN / System Split DNS | Profile → internal listeners → selected LinkProperties DNS, preserving IPv6 scope | User config; selected non-VPN Network DNS provider | VpnService protect + Network bind, stale-response SERVFAIL; `apps/usque_gui/android/app/src/main/kotlin/io/github/georgexie2333/usque/PhysicalNetworkMonitor.kt` `selectUnderlyingNetwork`; `crates/usque-transport/src/split_dns.rs` `SplitDnsResolver::handle`, `reply_for_generation`. Device/observer `not_run`. |
| Windows VPN / DoH or DoT | Profile → PacketStack → ConfiguredDnsProtector → explicit numeric bootstrap; encrypted bounds | User-selected encrypted provider sees direct QNAME; physical DNS metadata is not consumed by resolver | Agent exact-generation target TCP lease/interface/WFP; `crates/usque-agent/src/windows/server.rs` `AgentService::acquire_direct_egress`; `crates/usque-transport/src/encrypted_dns.rs` `EncryptedResolver::connect_one`. Startup still reads physical metadata for network state, not fallback. Observer `not_run`. |
| Android VPN / DoH or DoT | Android JSON → core validation → exact-Network resolver; encrypted bounds | User-selected encrypted provider; no system bootstrap lookup | Protect before exact Network bind; `crates/usque-android/src/lib.rs` `AndroidSocketProtector::bind_socket_for_generation`; `crates/usque-transport/src/encrypted_dns.rs` `EncryptedResolver::connect_one`. PR-12 removes unnecessary physical-DNS-list startup dependency; a usable non-VPN network is still required. Device `not_run`. |
| Windows proxy / System direct hostnames | Profile → NoopSocketProtector → OS resolver → direct target; existing tunnel fallback | OS-selected DNS provider and direct target | Geo defaults Tunnel; proxy is not VPN egress authorization; `crates/usque-engine/src/lib.rs` `ControlService::connect_with_cancellation_locked`, `load_geo_direct_policy`; `crates/usque-transport/src/socket.rs` `NoopSocketProtector`. System-proxy lease only configures loopback proxy use. |
| Android proxy / System direct hostnames | Proxy route policy → selected Network.getAllByName → bound target socket; no TUN DNS listener | Underlying Network DNS and direct target | Network binding without VpnService.protect; `crates/usque-android/src/lib.rs` `AndroidSocketRoutePolicy`, `AndroidSocketProtector::resolve`; `apps/usque_gui/android/app/src/main/kotlin/io/github/georgexie2333/usque/UsqueVpnService.kt` `resolveUnderlyingHost`, `bindSocketToUnderlyingGeneration`. The hostname lookup uses the current Network; only the socket bind is generation-checked. Device `not_run`. |
| Windows proxy / DoH or DoT | Noop protector → configured resolver → HTTP/SOCKS Geo caller; encrypted bounds, logical generation 0 | Configured encrypted provider and direct target | Strict TLS/no downgrade, but no Agent/WFP lease; `crates/usque-engine/src/lib.rs` `ControlService::connect_with_cancellation_locked`; `crates/usque-transport/src/encrypted_dns.rs` `configure_direct_dns`, `encrypted_tls_config`. No VPN Kill Switch promise. |
| Android proxy / DoH or DoT | Proxy policy → exact-Network resolver → HTTP/SOCKS; encrypted bounds | Configured encrypted provider and direct target | Generation binding without VpnService.protect; `crates/usque-android/src/lib.rs` `AndroidSocketProtector::bind_socket_for_generation`; `crates/usque-transport/src/geo_direct.rs` `connect_with_geo_fallback`. Device `not_run`. |
| Both platforms / independent proxy DNS modes | ProxyDnsMode for non-direct traffic: Remote uses the final DNS policy; LocalConfigured/System retain explicit local resolution; EdgeResolved leaves hostnames in L4 CONNECT authority, or sends them to an HTTP/SOCKS5 final proxy. A VPN-protocol chain converts EdgeResolved to Remote; leaving a stream-capable exit for an incompatible mode does the same | Mode-selected resolver, L4 edge or final proxy for EdgeResolved | Separate from direct_dns. Encrypted direct DNS failure is terminal; data fallback after a successful answer reuses those IPs; `crates/usque-core/src/config/mod.rs` `ProxyDnsMode`; `crates/usque-transport/src/dns.rs` `Resolver::resolve_candidates`; `crates/usque-transport/src/data_plane.rs` `final_profile`; `crates/usque-transport/src/geo_direct.rs` `connect_with_geo_fallback`. DoH direct selection is not a claim about unrelated port-53 traffic. |
| Windows active runtime / Deep DNS probe | Active runtime protector → separate short-lived pool → fixed reserved `example.invalid` | Explicit Deep caller; configured encrypted provider | 3.8 s I/O + cleanup within check/session limits; no business-pool mutation; `crates/usque-engine/src/lib.rs` `ControlService::diagnostic_probe_context`; `crates/usque-transport/src/diagnostic_probe.rs` `PROBE_IO_TIMEOUT`, `run_dns_probe`. Not an observer. |
| Windows disconnected / Deep DNS probe | Lifecycle exclusion → Noop protector → encrypted resolver, generation 0 | Explicit Deep caller; configured provider over normal host networking | TLS and bounded ownership only; no Agent physical snapshot/WFP proof; `crates/usque-engine/src/lib.rs` `ControlService::diagnostic_probe_context` (disconnected branch). Reachability is transport-only. |
| Android active/disconnected / Deep DNS probe | ServiceDiagnosticProbes → JNI → ProbeProtector → reserved query | One explicit pending probe; configured provider on current Network | Exact generation before/after bind, native cancellation slot and serialized worker; `crates/usque-android/src/diagnostic_probe.rs` `ProbeProtector`, `run_probe`; `apps/usque_gui/android/app/src/main/kotlin/io/github/georgexie2333/usque/ServiceDiagnosticProbes.kt` `ServiceDiagnosticProbes`. Device `not_run`. |
| All deployments / quality telemetry | Resolver enum/counter/RTT → 1 Hz snapshot → local UI memory | Runtime writes; local Engine/UI reads | No name/address/query payload fields; `crates/usque-transport/src/network_quality.rs` `DirectDnsQuality`; `apps/usque_gui/android/app/src/main/kotlin/io/github/georgexie2333/usque/NetworkQualityFields.kt` `NetworkQualityFields`. No automatic upload/history persistence. |
| Windows/Android / diagnostic ZIP | Snapshot/session/timeline/logs → allowlist → user-selected local file | Explicit exporting user | Custom DNS, endpoints, QNAME, secrets, paths, SSIDs and package lists excluded; `crates/usque-engine/src/maintenance.rs` `write_diagnostic_bundle`, `configuration_summary`; `apps/usque_gui/android/app/src/main/kotlin/io/github/georgexie2333/usque/AndroidMaintenance.kt` `writeDiagnostics`. Native timeline is separately bounded. |
| Explicit configuration serialization | Validated Profile → protobuf/Android JSON | Configuration caller receives chosen name/path/bootstrap/port | Intentionally preserves settings, unlike diagnostic export; `crates/usque-android/src/lib.rs` `android_profile_value`; `crates/usque-engine/src/lib.rs` `profile_to_proto`, `profile_from_proto`. Do not conflate these workflows. |
| Windows VPN / Geo direct TUN TCP/UDP | Numeric packet → DNS route hint/GeoIP → bounded generation-scoped gateway mapping | TUN client and explicitly direct target | No hostname re-resolution for numeric flow; exact target/protocol/interface Agent lease; `crates/usque-transport/src/direct_gateway.rs` `DirectGatewayRouter::route_outgoing`; `crates/usque-agent/src/windows/server.rs` `AgentService::acquire_direct_egress`. Observer `not_run`. |
| Android VPN / Geo direct TUN TCP/UDP | Same numeric gateway classification → protected exact Network socket | TUN client and explicitly direct target | Requires TUN-direct protector capability, bounded mapping and generation; `crates/usque-transport/src/direct_gateway.rs` `DirectGatewayRouter::route_outgoing`; `crates/usque-android/src/lib.rs` `AndroidSocketProtector::tun_direct_available`. Device/observer `not_run`. |

## 2. Trust boundaries, assets and objectives

Assets are configuration integrity; QNAME confidentiality and answer integrity;
exact physical egress authorization and lease lifetime; separation of Split,
WARP, physical and encrypted DNS; bounded sockets/queries/tasks; local user
traffic; sanitized metrics/exports; WARP key material and Agent operation
ownership. Credentials remain secure-store references, not model contents.

Boundaries are user/editor → authoritative core; shared configuration → hydrated
Profile; DNS wire input → bounded parser/route hints; transport → resolver;
Engine → authenticated privileged Agent; JNI → VpnService/Network; runtime →
local telemetry; and explicit diagnostic/configuration export → selected file.
Windows pipe authentication checks PID/SID/image/signer and operation ownership
(`crates/usque-agent/src/windows/auth.rs` `authenticate_named_pipe`;
`crates/usque-agent/src/windows/server.rs` `AgentService::acquire_direct_egress`). Android separates VPN protect
from proxy-only Network binding. System exposes direct names to the selected
physical provider by design; encrypted mode exposes them to the chosen TLS
provider, which can still return unwanted but syntactically valid answers.

Realistic attackers include a network observer/on-path actor, malicious
resolver, malformed-input sender, and a local or explicitly exposed proxy
client. A profile author controls DNS settings but cannot disable core TLS
validation. Unprivileged processes do not gain Agent permissions by knowing
a target IP. Host administrator/LocalSystem/root, a compromised OS, and an
already-authorized operator changing their own resolver are outside this model.

Objectives:

- `INV-DIRECT-DNS-NO-PLAINTEXT-FALLBACK`: encrypted failures are terminal or
  SERVFAIL. Numeric bootstrap never causes system lookup; post-resolution
  direct data fallback reuses the encrypted answer.
- Strict chain/name/time verification, canonical names, DoH ALPN/status/media/
  body validation, DoT framing and shared DNS response correlation; no early
  data, certificate-ignore control, custom production CA or hidden downgrade.
- PhysicalSystem is explicit; tunnel DNS is not silently replaced. Generation
  changes invalidate encrypted pools, queued replies and route hints.
- Socket protection precedes I/O; lease lifetime covers I/O destruction, with
  deployment differences above. Kill Switch rules are not relaxed for probes.
- Queue, pool, retry and deadline limits survive errors and cancellation;
  Standard remains read-only; Deep cleans its temporary resources.
- Local metrics and diagnostic exports exclude private names/addresses and
  cannot claim external zero-packet proof.

Assumptions: trusted platform network snapshots/binding, secure profile storage,
Geo data and public-root store; no DNSSEC, ODoH or resolver-content trust beyond
TLS plus DNS correlation is claimed. Architecture review and loopback tests
are not protected evidence. Windows VM, dedicated Android, independent
observer and controlled performance lab are all `not_run` here.

Resolved discrepancies and residual questions:

- README/installation privacy text now describes explicit encrypted modes;
  PR-00's historical baseline remains historical, not current authority.
- Android's former custom-mode physical-DNS-list prerequisite is removed and
  tested in PR-12; the non-VPN network requirement is retained.
- Desktop proxy/disconnected Noop protection is now explicitly documented,
  not mislabeled as Agent protection.
- Legacy PhysicalSystem exchanges use target-aware protection with pre/post
  generation checks, not every encrypted-path exact-generation overload.
  `resolve_physical_host` loops bounded server/A/AAAA lists with per-exchange
  limits, but has no single encrypted-style four-second total budget. These
  unchanged legacy semantics are not evidence of an encrypted fallback.
  Sources: `crates/usque-transport/src/split_dns.rs` `direct_udp`, `direct_tcp` and
  `resolve_physical_host`.
- Agent chooses a physical interface by the verified endpoint-path family,
  not a fresh route lookup for each custom resolver. Multi-homed reachability
  needs protected testing; failure is not permission to broaden routing.
  Source: `crates/usque-agent/src/windows/server.rs`
  `AgentService::physical_network_info`, `AgentService::acquire_direct_egress`.
- Actual zero port-53/direct-rule/candidate-path packet observations and
  platform cleanup remain unknown until exact-candidate protected evidence.

## 3. Prioritized attack stories (hypotheses, not findings)

| Priority | Scenario and attacker gain | Prerequisite / impact | Existing controls, mitigation and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High | On-path actor forces encrypted TLS/DNS failure hoping to obtain plaintext QNAME | Victim chose DoH/DoT and issues a direct query; confidentiality loss if a downgrade exists | Encrypted enum dispatch, numeric bootstrap, terminal errors/SERVFAIL and IP-reusing data fallback. Loopback/fault/proxy tests cover negative paths; independently observe port 53 before claiming packet proof. `crates/usque-transport/src/encrypted_dns.rs` `DirectDnsResolver::query`; `crates/usque-transport/src/split_dns.rs` `SplitDnsResolver::query_direct`; `crates/usque-transport/src/geo_direct.rs` `connect_with_geo_fallback`. |
| High | Network churn races setup/response delivery and sends data on the wrong network | VPN direct traffic, an actual generation race and failed ownership check | Exact-generation binding, I/O-owned leases, 100 ms pool observer, synchronous boundaries and queued-reply check; actor/generation tests. Verify real OS transitions on dedicated runners. `crates/usque-transport/src/encrypted_dns.rs` `EncryptedResolver::connect_one`, `DirectDnsResolver::with_tls_config`; `crates/usque-transport/src/split_dns.rs` `reply_for_generation`. |
| High | Unprivileged local process asks Agent for an unauthorized direct exception | Must cross pipe authentication and operation ownership; possible Kill Switch bypass | PID/SID/path/signer, exact target/protocol/interface, generation and registry caps; no generic route-bypass API. Agent unit tests and isolated WFP evidence, not public exploit claims. `crates/usque-agent/src/windows/auth.rs` `authenticate_named_pipe`; `crates/usque-agent/src/windows/server.rs` `AgentService::acquire_direct_egress`, `validate_direct_context`. |
| Medium | Malicious resolver returns cross-query, oversized or truncated data to poison a route hint or exhaust memory | Legitimate configured resolver connection; wrong destination or service degradation | ID/question/record/TTL/CNAME validation, capped response/body/query/task/pool sizes, one retry and deadlines; property tests and malformed TLS-server fixtures. Resolver returning a valid unwanted answer is a trust assumption, not TLS bypass. `crates/usque-transport/src/split_dns.rs` `validate_response`; `crates/usque-transport/src/encrypted_dns.rs` `EncryptedResolver::query_doh`, `validate_doh_headers`. |
| Medium | Proxy client floods requests or drops a partial exchange to retain sockets/tasks | Authorized local proxy access or explicitly exposed listener; availability impact | Four actual I/O permits, 64 queries, Split DNS 512-task cap, bounded waits/cancellation; cancellation/pool-saturation tests. Preserve these limits and run thermal/performance lab separately. `crates/usque-transport/src/encrypted_dns.rs` `EncryptedResolver::query`, `EncryptedResolver::connect_one`; `crates/usque-transport/src/split_dns.rs` `SplitDnsResolver`. |
| Medium | Private query/endpoint leaks through a failure, timeline or diagnostic bundle | User exports a bundle or an ordinary log captures raw data | Fixed enums/numbers, explicit export allowlist and bounded native bridge; adversarial export fixtures. Configuration export intentionally contains chosen DNS settings and is a different workflow. Desktop Debug-level Engine logs can contain sanitized TUN direct-flow error text; see [encrypted direct DNS](encrypted-direct-dns.md#privacy-and-validation-limits). `crates/usque-engine/src/maintenance.rs` `write_diagnostic_bundle`; `crates/usque-engine/src/logging.rs` `sanitize_log_bytes`; `crates/usque-android/src/connection_timeline.rs` `json_snapshot`. |
| Low | Doctor reachability result is interpreted as proof of VPN/packet-observer protection | User/operator misreads result; false assurance rather than demonstrated exploitation | Explicit transport-only/protection distinctions, N/A states, no local “zero leaks” claim, exact-candidate `not_run` matrix. [Network Doctor](network-doctor.md). |

## 4. Severity calibration

Critical would require a credible path from an untrusted DNS/proxy input to
privileged arbitrary code or broad key compromise, not merely an available
JNI symbol or an authorized administrator. No such finding is asserted here.
High includes a reproducible silent encrypted-to-plaintext downgrade or
unauthorized Kill Switch exception affecting victim traffic. Medium includes
cross-query response confusion or sustained remote resource exhaustion with
concrete access prerequisites. Low covers limited security-relevant disclosure
or misleading protection metadata without a stronger demonstrated impact.

Expected resolver visibility, explicit System mode, ordinary Windows proxy
networking, a rejected certificate, unavailable infrastructure, and a bounded
timeout are counterexamples: they are not by themselves vulnerabilities.
An already-authorized profile change is not an attacker privilege escalation.
Impact and confidence are separate: source mapping has high confidence about
call paths and limits, while real-device cleanup, multi-homed behavior and
external packet counts have no execution evidence in this run. Missing evidence
does not lower the impact of a real issue, and must never be turned into pass.

## Custom bypass extension (2026-09-30)

The working-tree extension adds explicit domain suffixes and address targets to
`GeoDirectPolicy`. This source analysis is separate from the historical review
above. A domain authorizes itself and label-boundary subdomains only; normalized
rules are bounded at 256 domains and 256 address networks. Malformed domain
errors expose an entry ordinal, not the domain. Diagnostic configuration exports
remain allowlisted and do not include custom target lists.

Custom domains use the same protected DNS resolver and exact-target egress
leases as GEO domains. No wildcard WFP authorization or platform privilege API
was added. DNS route hints retain their existing TTL, conflict handling and
network-generation checks and are destroyed with the session. A custom match
cannot rescue an enabled but invalid GEO catalog during startup. Proxy-only
chain underlays clear custom targets together with GEO and address exclusions.
Real VPN cleanup and externally observed leak tests remain `not_run` without
the required isolated environments.
