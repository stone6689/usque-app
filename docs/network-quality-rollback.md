# Network-quality emergency rollback

## Authority and defaults

`crates/usque-transport/src/feature_flags.rs` is the single internal build
decision point. All five production flags are true following deterministic
correctness/resource/compatibility checks; protected performance and leak
measurements remain `not_run`, not a claim of improvement. No ordinary user
configuration, environment variable or remote API can set these flags.
Instances receive an immutable copy; changing a build requires review,
rebuild and the ordinary gates in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

| Flag / capability | False behavior | Required regression evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `h2_tuned_flow_control` | Explicit Builder, stream and connection windows both 65,535; PING and cancel stay intact | H2 32-combination config and loopback capacity/cancel tests |
| `network_quality_metrics` | Stop quality events/payload/capability; existing business flow and safety counters remain active | Disabled sampler/counter, payload omission, initial/changed/periodic event suppression, and missing-capability GUI tests |
| `udp_batch_io` | Force portable send/receive even if batch mode was requested | Portable/forced-mode/order/truncation/cancel tests on Windows and Linux |
| `automatic_pmtu` | Fixed 1350-byte outer send maximum; no discovery or migration-triggered probe; EMSGSIZE safely reconnects | Fixed-1350 across-path and fail-closed error tests; inner MTU/PTB tests |
| `quic_migration` | No migration handle dispatch; existing full reconnect | Disabled-handle no-candidate test and supervisor generation/reconnect tests |
| `ENCRYPTED_DIRECT_DNS_ENABLED` | Advertise unsupported and reject saved DoH/DoT before connection | Core/runtime capability rejection; GUI preserves custom settings read-only until explicit user change |

Do not rewrite saved DoH/DoT to System. Users may explicitly select System,
with its normal privacy meaning. Do not change protobuf field numbers,
remove appended messages or lower `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` (currently 24;
direct DNS was added in schema 13). `ConfigStore::load` rejects a configuration
newer than the build supports, so a rollback build must still read the current
schema, including routing rules, Ads, WARP DNS and Zero Trust endpoint overrides. Reinstalling
v0.2.9 does not provide that compatibility with migrated schema-24 settings.
Old peers ignore unknown fields; absence of a capability disables only its new
UI/control.

## Procedure

1. Record affected platform/path, stable reason codes, exact candidate identity
   and available sanitized evidence. Never collect raw QNAME/endpoint/SSID/CID
   in ordinary logs or publish restricted packet captures.
2. Change the smallest internal flag/capability needed, keeping the default
   fail-closed contract and one data-bearing path. There is no live remote
   feature toggle. Do not weaken TLS, generation, lease, WFP or cleanup checks.
3. Run the complete change-scoped matrix from `CONTRIBUTING.md`, plus the
   feature's false-mode tests and [integration matrix](network-quality-acceptance.md).
   Use the Windows build helper, locked Flutter resolve and pinned Android
   helper. Fault-injection lab features must not enter release artifacts.
4. If protected runners are available, collect exact-candidate evidence in the
   correct environment. Missing/failed/`not_run` evidence remains explicit and
   supplemental; it is neither pass nor a new publication prerequisite.
5. Document the disabled behavior in release notes. Official packages still
   come only from the approved tag/staged-candidate workflow. A local build
   cannot replace a failed release job. This runbook authorizes no installation,
   signing-secret access, tag movement, publication or platform-state mutation.

Rollback does not dynamically raise TUN MTU, enable multipath, persist metric
history, upload diagnostics, or turn a local Doctor result into leak proof.
