# Public protocol test identities

These generated RSA identities are public test fixtures for the in-memory
OpenVPN peer. They do not identify a VPN Gate server, WARP® account, user, or
release signer. Never use them outside tests. The CA private key is discarded.
Certificates are valid from 2020 through 2050 so test execution is independent
of the generation date.

`tls-crypt.key` is a fixed, deliberately public synthetic key used only by the
memory peer. The password-only peer accepts `fixture-user` / `fixture-password`.
The protocol tests cover accepted and rejected credentials without an OS socket.

`client-encrypted.key` is the same public client fixture encrypted with the
public test passphrase `fixture-key-password` (OpenSSL PKCS#8, AES-256-CBC).
It exercises the private-key-password path during an actual memory handshake.
